# EE599-HW4-Q5
Write a function that implements heap-sort on a vector of integers. The function's return type should be void and the same input vector should get modified and sorted. You should use std::priority_queue to implement your function. Sample input: [5, 9, 3, 1, 7], output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
